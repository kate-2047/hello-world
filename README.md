# hello-world
the first project of many
I'm Katelyn.

I started coding almost a year ago and have really enjoyed it so far. I've taken two intro courses at my school and plan to take a Python AP in the upcoming school year. 

I have two dogs and two rabbits, I love them all very much :)
I like to read and play videos games on my laptop.
